	abstract = {The management and conservation of biodiversity relies on information on both the abundance of species and the potential impact of threats. Globally, one of the largest threats towards marine biodiversity is bycatch in fisheries. Under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), EU Member States are required to assess the status of species, such as the harbour porpoise (
              Phocoena phocoena
              ), in relation to their abundance and mortality due to bycatch every six years. The Vulnerable (HELCOM) Belt Sea population of harbour porpoise has been surveyed to determine its abundance six times using dedicated aerial or ship-based line-transect distance sampling surveys. Here, we estimated the first trend in population abundance over an 18 year period (2005-2022). Using the most recent abundance estimate, we computed a mortality limit applying the modified Potential Biological Removal (mPBR) method based on the regionally agreed conservation objective to restore or maintain 80\% of carrying capacity over 100 years with an 80\% probability. Over the past 18 years there has been a strong negative trend (-2.7\% p.a.; 95\% CI: -4.1\%; + 1.3\%) in abundance, with a 90.5\% probability. The mortality limit was estimated to be 24 animals, which the current bycatch estimates ({\textasciitilde}900 porpoises/year from the commercial Danish and Swedish set net fishery fleets, with no data from Germany and other fishery types) exceed by far. The frequency and quality of data available on abundance for this population are higher than those available for the majority of marine species. Given the observed population decline and likely unsustainable levels of bycatch, the results presented here provide a strong basis to make informed, evidence-based management decisions for action for this population. Such action is needed urgently, before the dire situation of other porpoise species and populations around the globe is repeated.},

	abstract = {Human activities in the oceans are increasing and can result in additional mortality on many marine Protected, Endangered or Threatened Species (PETS). It is necessary to implement ambitious measures that aim to restore biodiversity at all nodes of marine food webs and to manage removals resulting from anthropogenic activities. We developed a stochastic surplus production model (SPM) linking abundance and removal processes under the assumption that variations in removals reflect variations in abundance. We then consider several ‘harvest’ control rules, included two candidate ones derived from this SPM (which we called ‘Anthropogenic Removals Threshold’, or ART), to manage removals of PETS. The two candidate rules hinge on the estimation of a stationary removal rate. We compared these candidate rules to other existing control rules (
              e.g.
              potential biological removal or a fixed percentage rule) in three scenarios: (i) a base scenario whereby unbiased but noisy data are available, (ii) scenario whereby abundance estimates are overestimated and (iii) scenario whereby abundance estimates are underestimated. The different rules were tested on a simulated set of data with life-history parameters close to a small-sized cetacean species of conservation interest in the North-East Atlantic, the harbour porpoise (
              Phocoena phocoena
              ), and in a management strategy evaluation framework. The effectiveness of the rules were assessed by looking at performance metrics, such as time to reach the conservation objectives, the removal limits obtained with the rules or temporal autocorrelation in removal limits. Most control rules were robust against biases in data and allowed to reach conservation objectives with removal limits of similar magnitude when averaged over time. However, one of the candidate rule (ART) displayed greater alignment with policy requirements for PETS such as minimizing removals over time.},

	title = {Estimating a mortality threshold for the {Belt} {Sea} population of harbour porpoises},
	abstract = {For small cetaceans bycatch in fishing gear is one of the largest threats towards their conservation. In order to effectively manage this threat, an estimation of the maximum number of animals that can be killed by anthropogenic activities each year is required. Such calculations rely on species or population specific information on population dynamics, and information on the current state of the population relative to carrying capacity. Here, we calculate the mortality limit for the Belt Sea population of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) based on a modified potential biological removal (mPBR) method. We estimate that for the population to reach the conservation objective set by ASCOBANS (the population should reach 80\% of carrying capacity (assumed here to be 50,000 animals), with the assumption that this is achieved within 100 years with an 80\% probability) a maximum of 29 animals can be removed annually. This removal rate applies a recover factor (Fr) of 0.1 that accounts for many uncertainties in population dynamics, abundance estimates, and the current removal rate and depletion level of the population. However, even using the highest possible Fr value (1.0) (which is not recommended for populations with unknown status and does not allow the population to reach the conservation objective), the mPBR limit of the population is 292, which is still significantly lower than the current estimated levels of bycatch in this population ( 700 a year). Therefore, urgent action is required in order to ensure that this population is able to reach the conservation objective and achieve good environmental status under a range of European legislation.},

	url = {https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00643/75513/},
	abstract = {Climate change affects marine systems stability, in particular temperature increase induces a shift of the fish spatial distribution polewards. Phenology of ecological processes, such as reproduction, migration seasons, and species physiology subject to temperature increase are also expected to change. The ecosystem response to climate change implying all these processes remains unknown and difficult to estimate due to the numerous interactions between species. To better understand the relative importance of the different processes affected by climate change, we use the multispecies model OSMOSE applied to the eastern English Channel and we simulated two climate scenarios for 2040-2049 from IPCC (B1 and A2). For this study, climate change is assumed to affect 4 main processes: the primary production, reproduction seasonality, growth and spatial distribution. Simulations followed a full factorial design in order to explore separate effects of each process as well as their combinations. The projections of IPCC scenarios on the system showed that reproduction seasonality is the process affecting the most total and species biomasses, while spatial distribution has a moderate effect of the different indicators studied. The interactions between species lead to antagonistic or synergistic combined effects of the different processes. When considering all processes simultaneously, the simulated state of the ecosystem in the 2040’s is characterized by a decrease of predators’ biomass weakening the system and leading to the prevalence of some intermediate-level predators.},

	abstract = {Marine megafauna plays an important functional role in marine ecosystems as top predators but are threatened by a wide range of anthropogenic activities. Bycatch, the incidental capture of non-targeted species in commercial and recreational fisheries, is of particular concern for small cetacean species, such as dolphins and porpoises. In the North-East Atlantic, common dolphin (
              Delphinus delphis
              , Linné 1758) bycatch has been increasing and associated with large numbers of animals stranding during winter on the French Atlantic seashore since at least 2017. However, uncertainties around the true magnitude of common dolphin bycatch and the fisheries involved have led to delays in the implementation of mitigation measures. Current data collection on dolphin bycatch in France is with non-dedicated observers deployed on vessels for the purpose of national fisheries sampling programmes. These data cannot be assumed representative of the whole fisheries' bycatch events. This feature makes it difficult to use classic ratio estimators since they require a truly randomised sample of the fishery by dedicated observers. We applied a newly developed approach, regularised multilevel regression with post-stratification, to estimate total bycatch from unrepresentative samples and total fishing effort. The latter is needed for post-stratification and the former is analysed in a Bayesian framework with multilevel regression to regularise and better predict bycatch risk. We estimated the number of bycaught dolphins for each week and 10 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) divisions from 2004 to 2020 by estimating jointly bycatch risk, haul duration, and the number of hauls per days at sea (DaS). Bycatch risk in pair trawlers flying the French flag was the highest in winter 2017 and 2019 and was associated with the longest haul durations. ICES divisions 8.a and 8.b (shelf part of the Bay of Biscay) were estimated to have the highest common dolphin bycatch. Our results were consistent with independent estimates of common dolphin bycatch from strandings. Our method show cases how non-representative observer data can nevertheless be analysed to estimate fishing duration, bycatch risk and, ultimately, the number of bycaught dolphins. These weekly-estimates improve upon current knowledge of the nature of common dolphin bycatch and can be used to inform management and policy decisions at a finer spatio-temporal scale than has been possible to date. Our results suggest that limiting haul duration, especially in winter, could serve as an effective mitigation strategy.},

	abstract = {Bycatch, the undesirable and non-intentional catch of non-target species in marine ﬁsheries, is one of the main causes of mortality of marine mammals worldwide. When quantitative conservation objectives and management goals are clearly deﬁned, computer-based procedures can be used to explore likely population dynamics under different management scenarios and estimate the levels of anthropogenic removals, including bycatch, that marine mammal populations may withstand. Two control rules for setting removal limits are the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) established under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Removals Limit Algorithm (RLA) inspired from the Catch Limit Algorithm (CLA) developed under the Revised Management Procedure of the International Whaling Commission. The PBR and RLA control rules were tested in a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) framework. A key feature of PBR and RLA is to ensure conservation objectives are met in the face of the multiple uncertainties or biases that plague real-world data on marine mammals. We built a package named RLA in the R software to carry out MSE of control rules to set removal limits in marine mammal conservation. The package functionalities are illustrated by two case studies carried out under the auspices of the Oslo and Paris convention (OSPAR) (the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) Marine Mammal Expert Group (OMMEG) in the context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The ﬁrst case study sought to tune the PBR control rule to the conservation objective of restoring, with a probability of 0.8, a cetacean population to 80\% of carrying capacity after 100 years. The second case study sought to further develop a RLA to set removals limit on harbor porpoises in the North Sea with the same conservation objective as in the ﬁrst case study. Estimation of the removals limit under the RLA control rule was carried out within the Bayesian paradigm. Outputs from the functions implemented in the package RLA allows the assessment of user-deﬁned performance metrics, such as time to reach a given fraction of carrying capacity under a given level of removals compared to the time needed given no removals.},
