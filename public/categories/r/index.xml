      <description>RLA in 2 words&#xD;RLA is an R package that aims to estimate removal limit of marine mammals species. Limits are estimated thanks to a control rule which is linked to a biological model of the species. The control rule correspond to an equation/algorithm that gives the limit of individuals which can be removed from the population. The coupled model has a chronological dimension to project future management scenarios of removal mitigation (For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say we decrease fishing effort which is a major threat for our population of marine mammal, what could be the resulting situation in 50 years ?</description>
