      <description>RLA in 2 words&#xD;RLA is an R package that aims to estimate removal limit of marine mammals species. Limits are estimated thanks to a control rule which is linked to a biological model of the species. The control rule correspond to an equation/algorithm that gives the limit of individuals which can be removed from the population without threatening its long-term viability (the definition of long-term viability must be provided by users).</description>
