  I'm a data scientist. I worked 5 years as an R package developper in a lab working on marine mammals in France. I was in charge of developping an R package from scripts to ease routine analysis. I have also developed shiny applications and automated reports with quarto which enabled me to get to grips with other computer languages such as html and css to customize the UI experience.

  On my spare time i enjoy playing tennis, play chess, go running and code ;-)
