__"pelaverse"__ is a gitlab group that gather a bunch of packages created by [pelagis](https://www.observatoire-pelagis.cnrs.fr/). Its name is a reference to the [__tidyverse__](https://www.tidyverse.org/), _"a collection of packages"_ helping to manipulate, visualize data. In the same spirit as tidyverse, pelaverse aims at gathering R packages used/created by pelagis. Those packages are mainly used for routine analysis of aerial campaign data.
